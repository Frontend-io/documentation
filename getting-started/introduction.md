# Introduction

Start receiving one time and recurring payments in your website or application right away. Within a few minutes you can integrate Paystack into any application using our libraries, plugins or APIs. 

## Receiving Payments

Customers can start paying you very easily on your website or mobile app when you integrate Paystack using our [libraries, plugins and SDKs](https://developers.paystack.co/docs/libraries-and-plugins) and manage everything seamlessly from [your Paystack Dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.com). Paystack handles the secure transfer of sensitive card details so you don't have to worry about them. With one single integration, you'll be able to receive money via multiple payment channels including card, direct bank debit, Visa QR and USSD.
